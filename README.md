# PPP Payroll Case Study
This is a C# implementation of the Payroll Case Study from Uncle Bob's book [Agile Software Development - Principles, Patterns, and Practices](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445).
It's based on the original book (not the C# one), though I'm interested how the two implementations compare.
